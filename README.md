# Survival Analysis
---
This is a repo constructed for the study of survival analysis. Thanks to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis) and Princeton's course on [Generalized Linear Models](http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/notes). All theory part will be put in this markdown file, and some practice examples will be illustrated in a jupyter notebook.
